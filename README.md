# MauiReactor Rive-App

Sample application build with [MauiReactor](https://github.com/adospace/reactorui-maui) showing a nice UI (.NET MAUI implementation of https://designcode.io/swiftui-rive-animated-app).

This sample app showcases many MauiReactor features like RxAnimation and AnimationController and shows how you leverage even complex UI/UX using .NET MAUI using a MVU approach similar to SwiftUI and Flutter.

The original app uses Rive animations (take a look [here](https://rive.app/) for more info) but I had to replace them with custom ones directly build in MauiReactor or using Lottie. Rive app is not yet available for .NET MAUI.

I strongly encourage you to take a look at [MauiReactor](https://github.com/adospace/reactorui-maui) repository before looking at the source code of this app.
